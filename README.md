Functional Analysis and the study of Basis Functions
=========================

Functional Analysis consists on the study of vector spaces and operations on that spaces that obey special kinds of properties defined to it. The most common example of such study subject is 
an n-dimensional real vector, that is an object that lives in $\mathbb{R}^n$ space. They obey certain rules related to dot products and norms while having operations done on them like linear maps
done through matrices. 

In a more general sense, it is possible to introduce an infinite dimensional complex vector space with inner product and norms, that is, a Hilbert space, in which vectors and functions become one and the same. With this vector behavior of functions, then all general theorems for vectors apply to functions providing advantages in their computation, representation, and operations. One of these advantages is the selection of special basis that can be used to represent any function by a linear combination of the basis just like in the case of vectors.
Such selection of basis functions should span the whole Hilbert Space.

As in linear algebra, there exist sets of orthogonal basis in which functions are orthogonal. For functions, orthogonality is defined in terms of the inner product being 0, in which these inner products are computed as integrals of the product of the two input functions. The usefulness of orthogonal polynomials comes from the ability to decompose any function into the linear combination of orthogonal functions and then utilize mathematical relations that can be apply in general to the orthogonal basis.

Orthogonal polynomials are used in many areas such as differential and integral equations, interpolation, numerical integration with Quadrature rules, eigenvalue problems, conformal mapping, and polynomial chaos in statistics.
